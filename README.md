# Backend of My Personal Website

That is the backend of my personal website where I share some of my artwork and 
learn about web development.

The project uses:

* Frontend: Angular
* Backend: Node.js and Express.js
* Database: MySQL

The site is still under development and the documentation is not complete. 

# How to Launch:

```
 SET DEBUG=express-node-js:* 
 npm start
 ```
